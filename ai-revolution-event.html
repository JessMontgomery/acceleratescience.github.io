      <h3>An AI revolution in science?</h3>
      <p>
<strong>What role could AI play in advancing the frontiers of science? And how can researchers benefit from advances in AI technologies? Neil Lawrence, DeepMind Professor Machine Learning here, will host a panel discussion on Monday 26 April to debate these questions.</strong>
<br />
<br />
        Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to become an engine for scientific discovery across disciplines â€“ from predicting the impact of climate change, to using genetic data to create new healthcare treatments, and from finding new astronomical phenomena to identifying new materials here on Earth. But achieving this potential will require new research collaborations to create the AI tools that can help tackle these and other key scientific challenges of the 21st century. 
<br />
<br />
On 26 April, at an event hosted by the Accelerate Programme for Scientific Discovery will convene an international panel of contributors to explore how AI can help advance the frontiers of science and how researchers can benefit from using AI in their work.
<br />
<br />
Hosted by Professor Neil Lawrence, the event will feature contributions from:
<ul>
<li> Kyle Cranmer, Professor of Physics, New York University;
<li> Emily Shuckburgh, Director of Cambridge Zero, University of Cambridge;
<li> Pushmeet Kohli, Head of AI for Science, DeepMind; and
<li> Yolanda Gil, Professor of Computer Science, USC.
</ul>
<br />
The discussion will start at 17:00 BST and is open to anyone interested in attending. To attend, please register <a href="https://cl-cam-ac-uk.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_zXoPojg0SBimi0SJjgY89w">here</a>.
