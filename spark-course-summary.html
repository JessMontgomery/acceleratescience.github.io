      <h3>July Data Science for Science Residency - Applications Open</h3>
      <p>
       PhD students and postdocs across Cambridge have another chance to apply for a funded training course that is successfully equipping scientists with powerful tools to progress their research.  The next Data for Science Residency will run for five weeks from Monday 19 July 2021. Applications open today.

The course aims to give researchers in fields outside computer science the skills they need to use machine learning (ML) in their research and helps them apply data analysis to their own datasets and problems.
