      <h3>Predicting outcome for psychotic disorders, using brain connectivity and transcribed speech data</h3>
      <p>
<strong>How can we use machine learning to improve treatments for mental health conditions? On Tuesday 27 April, Sarah Morgan will present her work at a seminar in the Department of Computer Science and Technology.</strong>
<br />
<br />
        Psychotic disorders affect approximately 1% of the population (Perälä et al., 2007) and are among the most disabling health conditions. Currently, these disorders are diagnosed solely through clinical assessments of patients’ symptoms, which can be subjective, with no automated, quantitative metrics available to clinicians. The biological mechanisms underlying these disorders are also poorly understood. I will discuss work using both transcribed speech and brain connectivity data to tackle these challenges, drawing on approaches from Network Science, NLP and Machine Learning. 
<br />
<br />
The discussion will start at 13:15 BST. Joining details are available <a href="https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/seminars/list/155446">here</a>.
